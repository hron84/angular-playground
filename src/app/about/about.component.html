                Did you know bears like phising? They stand near the leaks and waits for some data to
                pop up for fresh air. When they see one, then they swing their paw to prevent them
                turning back at the leak.

                While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the
                remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. With the exception of courting individuals
                and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal
                and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept
                runners,
                climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy
                their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.

                Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for
                bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance.
                With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other
                cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through
                encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market.
                The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as
                the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade
                of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.
